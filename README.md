## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- **Tailwind customization:** I learned how to extend Tailwind's default configuration to add custom colors, fonts, and responsive breakpoints, which made the design more unique and tailored to the project's needs.
- **CSS subgrid:** I learned how to use the CSS subgrid feature to create more flexible and consistent layouts, especially for aligning nested grid items, which improved layout control and maintainability.
- **Display contents:** I learned how to apply the CSS `display: contents` property to make an element's children participate directly in the parent layout, which simplified markup and allowed for more flexible layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - This tool helped me to view and inspect the design in more detail such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`, to get a perfect and consistent result.
